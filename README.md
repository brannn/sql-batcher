## Why SQL Batcher?

Large-scale database operations are often challenging for data engineers and developers: poor performance due to excessive round-trips, memory overflows during bulk operations, network bottlenecks, and complex transaction management to ensure consistency. SQL Batcher provides a comprehensive toolkit designed to help lessen these problems through intelligent statement batching, optimized memory usage, and database-specific optimizations.

SQL Batcher's core components include:

- **SQL Batcher Class**: The central engine that intelligently **batches SQL statements** with **column-aware capabilities** based on configurable size limits and database constraints
- **Insert Merger**: Optimizes performance by **combining compatible INSERT statements** while preserving execution order of other statements
- **Database Adapters**: Provides **database-specific optimizations** for Trino, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and more with a consistent interface
- **Async Support**: Offers full **asynchronous execution** capabilities with dedicated async adapters and context managers
- **Transaction Management**: Simplifies data consistency with **transaction control** and **savepoint support** for partial rollbacks
- **Context Managers**: Enables **clean resource management** with automatic flushing and proper cleanup in both sync and async modes
- **Retry Facility**: Implements intelligent **error recovery** with configurable retry strategies
- **Developer Experience**: Provides an **intuitive API** with **extensibility** options for custom adapters and configurations

SQL Batcher is particularly valuable in data engineering workflows, ETL pipelines, large dataset ingestion, and any scenario requiring high-performance database operations.

## Key Features

SQL Batcher provides a comprehensive set of features for efficient SQL statement execution:

### [SQL Batcher](docs/batcher.md)

Efficiently batch SQL statements based on size limits and other constraints. The core component that handles:

- **Smart batching** based on database-specific size limits
- **Dynamic batch size adjustment** based on column count
- **Memory and network optimization**

- [Learn more about Transaction Management →](docs/transactions.md)

### [Savepoint Support](docs/savepoints.md)

Create intermediate points within a transaction for partial rollbacks:

- **Create, rollback to, and release savepoints**
- **Error recovery** within transactions
- **Support for complex transaction workflows**
- [Learn more about Savepoint Support →](docs/savepoints.md)

pip install sql-batcher
```

With database-specific dependencies:

```bash
# For Trino support
pip install "sql-batcher[trino]"

# For PostgreSQL support
pip install "sql-batcher[postgresql]"

# For Snowflake support
pip install "sql-batcher[snowflake]"

# For BigQuery support
pip install "sql-batcher[bigquery]"

# For all supported databases
pip install "sql-batcher[all]"

# For development (includes testing and linting tools)
pip install "sql-batcher[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started with SQL Batcher:

```python
from sql_batcher import SQLBatcher
from sql_batcher.adapters import TrinoAdapter

# Create adapter and batcher
adapter = TrinoAdapter(
    host="trino.example.com",
    port=8080,
    user="trino",
    catalog="hive",
    schema="default",
    role="admin",  # Trino role (sets 'x-trino-role' HTTP header as 'system=ROLE{role}')
    max_query_size=600_000  # 600KB limit to provide buffer for Trino's 1MB limit
)

batcher = SQLBatcher(
    adapter=adapter,
    max_bytes=500_000,  # 500KB limit
    batch_mode=True,
    auto_adjust_for_columns=True  # Adjust batch size based on column count
)

# Process statements
statements = [
    "INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (1, 'a')",
    "INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (2, 'b')",
    # ... many more statements
]

# Process all statements in batches
batcher.process_statements(statements, adapter.execute)
```

For async usage:

```python
import asyncio
from sql_batcher import AsyncSQLBatcher
from sql_batcher.adapters.async_trino import AsyncTrinoAdapter

async def main():
    # Create async adapter and batcher
    adapter = AsyncTrinoAdapter(
        host="trino.example.com",
        port=8080,
        user="trino",
        catalog="hive",
        schema="default",
        role="admin",  # Trino role (sets 'x-trino-role' HTTP header as 'system=ROLE{role}')
        max_query_size=600_000  # 600KB limit to provide buffer for Trino's 1MB limit
    )

    batcher = AsyncSQLBatcher(
        adapter=adapter,
        max_bytes=500_000,  # 500KB limit
        batch_mode=True,
        auto_adjust_for_columns=True  # Adjust batch size based on column count
    )

    # Process statements asynchronously
    statements = [
        "INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (1, 'a')",
        "INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (2, 'b')",
        # ... many more statements
    ]

    await batcher.process_statements(statements, adapter.execute)

    # Close the connection
    await adapter.close()

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```
