Summary of Purpose and Capabilities
Purpose: sql-batcher is a Python library designed to optimize large-scale SQL operations by batching SQL statements, intelligently merging inserts, managing transaction size, and applying database-specific optimizations. It is particularly valuable in data engineering, ETL pipelines, and large dataset ingestion.
Key Capabilities:
	•	Smart Batching: Groups SQL statements dynamically based on max byte limits, database restrictions, and memory constraints.
	•	Insert Merging: Combines multiple INSERT statements into a single bulk operation to reduce round trips.
	•	Column-Aware Batching: Adjusts batch size automatically based on the number of columns (i.e., wider rows reduce batch size).
	•	Database Adapter Layer: Supports database-specific behavior (e.g., PostgreSQL, Trino, Snowflake, BigQuery, Spark) via a clean adapter pattern.
	•	Query Monitoring: Offers a QueryCollector to track, monitor, and report SQL execution metrics.
	•	Extensible Configuration: Customizable batch sizes, toggles for auto-adjustments, and merge strategies.
	•	Testing: Includes example projects and test infrastructure.
	•	Tooling: Provides code formatters (black, flake8), type checking (mypy), and pre-commit hooks.

Architectural Assessment
I'll score the library against the design criteria you outlined:

1. Separation of Concerns – Good
	•	Database Connection Management: Cleanly abstracted via "Adapter" classes (e.g., PostgreSQLAdapter, TrinoAdapter).
	•	Query Building: Centralized batching and merging logic inside SQLBatcher.
	•	Batch Processing Logic: Encapsulated in SQLBatcher, separate from adapters and collectors.
	•	Error Handling: There is basic error propagation but could be expanded with more granular custom exceptions.
	•	Result Processing: Handled externally by the user’s provided execution function (good separation).
Verdict: Excellent separation overall.

2. Extensibility – Good with Room to Grow
	•	Multiple Database Backends: Already supports multiple backends with a clear Adapter interface.
	•	Customizable Batch Sizes: Yes (e.g., max_bytes, max_statements).
	•	Flexible Transaction Handling: Partly – it delegates transaction handling to the adapter or external function, which is flexible but not deeply integrated.
	•	Plugin System for Pre/Post Processing: Not explicitly implemented yet, but design is clean enough to add it later.
Verdict: Extensible and future-proof, but a plugin system would be a next logical feature.

3. Good Coding Hygiene – Good
	•	Documentation: Good README, usage examples, and explanation of key features.
	•	Tests: There is a tests/ directory with decent coverage, although it could be more exhaustive (e.g., edge cases, failure scenarios).
	•	Type Hints: Extensive use of type hints across the codebase.
	•	Consistent Coding Style: Clean Python 3 style, enforced with black, flake8, and mypy.
	•	Clear Naming Conventions: Very readable and sensible names.
	•	Error Handling: Could use more robust custom exception classes to distinguish different error types.
Verdict: Solid hygiene, only slight improvement needed around testing completeness and exception robustness.

4. Performance Considerations – Decent
	•	Connection Pooling: Not built-in. It assumes external pooling (fair enough for a batching tool).
	•	Parameterized Queries: Leaves query parameterization to the adapter or caller, so it depends on the adapter's execution method.
	•	Efficient Memory Usage: Designed for memory efficiency by batching before dispatching.
	•	Timeout Handling: No explicit timeout mechanisms; again assumed to be handled at adapter/caller layer.
	•	Retry Mechanisms: No built-in retries; could be added optionally later.
Verdict: Core performance needs (batching, memory management) are well handled. Advanced features like retries/timeouts would be a bonus.

5. API Design – Very Good
	•	Intuitive Interface: Using SQLBatcher with Adapter objects is intuitive.
	•	Functional and OO Approach: Primarily object-oriented but leaves room for the caller to pass functional execution handlers.
	•	Context Managers: No built-in context managers for adapters (e.g., auto-close connection), but you could easily add them.
	•	Async Support: Currently synchronous only. No async support yet, which would be a great enhancement for modern ETL workloads.
Verdict: API is well-designed for the synchronous world, but async support would future-proof it even better.

Overall Verdict
Category
Grade
Comments
Separation of Concerns
Excellent
Adapters, batcher, collector are cleanly separated.
Extensibility
Good
Adapter pattern is flexible; plugin system possible.
Coding Hygiene
Good+
Clean typing, linting, docs; exceptions could improve.
Performance Optimization
Decent+
Smart batching good; retries, timeouts missing.
API Design
Very Good
Intuitive, needs async to reach "excellent" tier.

Final Thoughts
sql-batcher is a very well-architected, extensible, and production-grade library for intelligent SQL statement batching, especially in data engineering workflows. It aligns well with professional engineering standards and with a few enhancements (better exceptions, async support, optional retries), it could become one of the best libraries in this niche.
