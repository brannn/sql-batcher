Roadmap for sql-batcher Improvements
1. Async Support
	•	Add an AsyncSQLBatcher sibling class.
	•	Define async-compatible adapters (e.g., AsyncPostgreSQLAdapter) using asyncpg, aiomysql, or other async DB drivers.
	•	Support both sync and async execution models for wider adoption in fast ETL and microservice pipelines.
Why? Modern Python applications (especially FastAPI, aiohttp-based, or asyncio-driven ETL pipelines) demand async I/O for maximum throughput.

2. Custom Exception Hierarchy
	•	Define specific exception classes:
	◦	SQLBatcherError
	◦	BatchSizeExceededError
	◦	InvalidQueryError
	◦	AdapterConnectionError
	•	Raise precise exceptions instead of generic ones.
Why? Makes it easier for users to programmatically handle different failure modes during execution.

3. Retry and Timeout Handling
	•	Implement an optional retry policy (e.g., using tenacity library or a lightweight custom retry wrapper).
	•	Allow user-defined:
	◦	Maximum retries
	◦	Backoff strategies
	◦	Timeout limits for batch execution
Why? Robustness: batches that temporarily fail (e.g., network hiccups, transient DB overload) could auto-retry safely without manual intervention.

4. Plugin/Hook System
	•	Allow users to inject custom pre-batch and post-batch hooks:
	◦	Preprocessing SQL
	◦	Logging metrics
	◦	Auditing queries
	•	Hook architecture could be simple (on_pre_batch, on_post_batch) or pluggable with entrypoints (like Flask or Airflow plugins).
Why? Increases extensibility without needing to fork the library for custom workflows.

5. Context Manager Support
	•	Implement __enter__ and __exit__ on adapters and batchers:
python
CopyEdit
with SQLBatcher(adapter=TrinoAdapter(...)) as batcher:
    batcher.add("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (1, 'bar')")
	•	Ensure connections are cleanly closed automatically if opened internally.
Why? Resource safety and code cleanliness.

6. Enhanced Metrics and Monitoring
	•	Track and expose:
	◦	Number of statements batched
	◦	Total bytes sent
	◦	Average batch size
	◦	Execution time per batch
	•	Optional integration with logging or metrics libraries like prometheus_client.
Why? Enables users to monitor throughput and debug slowdowns without intrusive instrumentation.

7. Connection Pooling Helpers (Optional)
	•	Offer built-in light helpers for connection pooling setup (e.g., using SQLAlchemy pools).
	•	Could be offered as optional utilities, not hard dependency.
Why? Improves scaling performance, especially for high-frequency batch workloads.

8. Expanded Testing and Benchmarking
	•	Add benchmarks:
	◦	Insert batching vs naive inserts
	◦	Different databases (Trino, Postgres, Snowflake)
	•	Increase test coverage to 90%+.
	•	Add property-based tests with hypothesis for fuzzing unusual batch inputs.
Why? Gives confidence that optimizations work across DBs and data volumes.

9. Codebase Refinements
	•	Minor refinements:
	◦	Move shared utilities to a utils/ or common/ module.
	◦	Clarify public vs internal API surface (e.g., dunder methods, underscore-prefixed helpers).
	•	Modularize configuration handling (batch size logic, byte counting).
Why? Future maintainability and easier onboarding for contributors.

Example Vision Statement for v2.0
"SQLBatcher v2.0 is the high-performance, fully extensible SQL batching framework for Python, offering first-class support for sync and async execution, fine-grained error handling, flexible retry policies, dynamic plugin integrations, and out-of-the-box metrics tracking."
